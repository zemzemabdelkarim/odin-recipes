    <h3>Couscous Discription</h3>

    <p>Couscous (Arabic: كُسْكُس, romanized: kuskus) is a traditional North African dish[5][6] of small[a] steamed granules of rolled semolina[7] that is often served with a stew spooned on top.
        Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.
        [8][9]: 18 [10]
        Couscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya.
        [11][12]: 250  It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century,[13] through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.
        [14][15][16]In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.[17]
