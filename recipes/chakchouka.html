    <h3>Chakchouka Discription</h3>

    <p>
        Make the shakshuka tomato sauce.
        Start by sauteing chopped onions, bell peppers, and garlic with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy skillet or pan (with a lid).
        Season with kosher salt and coriander, paprika, cumin, and crushed pepper flakes.
        Cook for at least 5 minutes, stirring, until the veggies are tender, then add fresh diced tomatoes (I used 6 vine ripe tomatoes) and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.
        (Or, if you don’t have fresh tomatoes, you can use canned a large 28-ounce of canned whole tomatoes or 6 cups of canned diced tomatoes).
        Bring the tomatoes to a boil, then cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes, then uncover and cook a few more minutes until your sauce has thickened.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion chopped</li>
        <li>2 green peppers chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes optional</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>6 medium tomatoes, chopped (about 6 cups chopped tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. Add the onions, green peppers, garlic, spices, pinch salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomatoes and tomato sauce. Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Uncover and cook a bit longer to allow the mixture to reduce and thicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a wooden spoon, make 6 indentations, or “wells,” in the tomato mixture (make sure the indentations are spaced out). Gently crack an egg into each indention.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook on low until the egg whites are set.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uncover and add the fresh parsley and mint. You can add more black pepper or crushed red pepper, if you like. Serve with warm pita, challah, or crusty bread of your choice.
        </li>
    </ol>
