    <h3>Mulukhiyah Discription</h3>
    <p>Mulukhiyah, also known as mulukhiyya , molokhiyya, melokhiyya, or ewédú, is a type of jute plant and a dish made from the leaves of Corchorus olitorius, commonly known in English as jute, jute leaves, jute mallow, nalta jute, or tossa jute.
        [3][4] It is used as a vegetable and is mainly eaten in Egypt, the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan), Sudan, Cyprus, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria.
        [5] It is called saluyot in the Philippines. Mulukhiyah is rather bitter, and when boiled, the resulting liquid is a thick, highly mucilaginous broth; it is often described as "slimy", rather like cooked okra.
        [6][7] Mulukhiyah is generally eaten cooked, not raw, and it is either eaten chopped and sautéed in oil, garlic and cilantro like in Syria or turned into a kind of soup or stew like in Egypt, typically bearing the same name as the vegetable in the local language.
        Traditionally mulukhiyah is cooked with chicken or at least chicken stock for flavor and is served with white rice, accompanied with lemon or lime.
        In Tunisia, the dish is prepared with jute powder instead of the leaves and cooked with lamb or beef to be served with bread.
        In Haiti, a dish is prepared fron jute leaves, which is called Lalo.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 bags frozen mulukhiya each bag is 400 g (15oz)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon mixed spices or seven spices</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ice cube (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 bunch coriander (cilantro) choppepd</li>
        <li>8-10 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>fresh lemon juice for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken stock back into a large saucepan. On medium heat, add the diced onion, the bags of mulukihya (you don't need to thaw them), the ground coriander, mixed or seven spices, and a big pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the ice cube (optional), and return the shredded chicken to the pot and bring mixture to a simmer. Simmer for five minute or so until mulukihya has completely melted and warmed through, and is just about to come to a boil. Don't let it boil, or it'll turn slimy.</li>
        <li>While mulukihya is simmering, place olive oil in a skillet, and heat on medium. Add the chopped coriander and crushed garlic, and sauté for a couple minutes until garlic just turns light golden brown. Add this mixture to the mulukhiya stew, and stir through. Taste for seasoning and adjust.</li>
        <li>If you like the mulukhiya thinner, you can add a little more broth. Serve with rice, and lemon juice on the side.</li>
    </ol>
