    <h3>Lasagna Discription</h3>

    <p>Lasagna (UK: /ləˈzænjə/,[1] US: /ləˈzɑːnjə/, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]), also known as lasagne (Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]), is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made in very wide, flat sheets.
        The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.
        [3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking.
        Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno).
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
